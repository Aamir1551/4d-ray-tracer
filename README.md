# 4D ray tracer
A ray tracer made using the C/C++ programming language and also following Google's coding standards


TODO
1) Refactor using smart pointers (And use valgrind for memory leaks)
2) Add "k" infront of constants -- google coding standards - To Follow standards
3) Add if/ndef on all headers/header guards
4) Add destructors


Once 3d ray tracer has been made, the ray tracer will then be used to model 4Dimensional objects.
